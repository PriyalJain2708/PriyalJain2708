  I strongly belive we the professionals of tech industry need to learn and innovate. There is constant change in the technologies in the tech market we need to update ourselves     with. The only thing that is constant is change. I would call myself an intersection of developer and designer, Currently I am playing with React Native and front end      development .Its the place where i   stay focused on, I love trying out new technologies and update with modern tools helping our lives more easier.
  
  Happy Coding :)
